# HomeHub

HomeHub turns `mpv` into a client for your favorite self
hosted media service(s). HomeHub is a WIP. There is a rather
usable Jellyfin client with text based UI already
implemented. I plan to implement a GUI with thumbnails and
clients for other services. The Plugin API is not exactly
stable, but can be used to implement external clients or
different UI's.

## Goals

- GUI similar to
  [mpv-gallery-view](https://github.com/occivink/mpv-gallery-view)
- Navidrome client
- Plex client
- Audiobookshelf client
- ????
